- **B2B integration**: EDI, AS2, and partner communications
- **IoT scenarios**: Device data processing and real-time analytics

## 2. Workflow Architecture
>A **workflow** is the complete process definition that includes triggers, actions, conditions, and control structures. Each workflow is a JSON-based definition that describes the business logic and integration requirements.

### Workflow Components:
- **Definition**: JSON schema describing the workflow structure
- **Parameters**: Input values that can be passed to the workflow
- **Variables**: Store and manipulate data during execution
- **Outputs**: Return values from the workflow
- **Run History**: Execution logs and status tracking
- **Metadata**: Workflow properties and configuration

### Workflow Types:
- **Stateful workflows**: Maintain state between runs, support checkpointing
- **Stateless workflows**: No state persistence, faster execution, lower cost

### Workflow States:
- **Enabled**: Workflow can be triggered and executed
- **Disabled**: Workflow cannot be triggered
- **Suspended**: Temporarily paused execution
- **Terminated**: Permanently stopped execution

## 3. Triggers (Detailed)
>**Triggers** are events that initiate workflow execution. They define when and how a workflow starts running.

### Types of Triggers:

- Configurable recurrence patterns
- **Polling Interval**: Minimum 15 seconds to 1 year
- **Polling Strategy**: Optimized to reduce costs

#### **Push Triggers**
- Respond immediately to events
- Examples: HTTP requests, Azure Event Grid, Service Bus messages
- Real-time execution
- **Webhook-based**: Immediate notification
- **Event-driven**: No polling overhead

#### **Recurrence Triggers**
- Schedule-based execution
- Support for complex scheduling patterns (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Time zone considerations
- **Cron expressions**: Advanced scheduling
- **Start time**: Specify when to begin recurring

#### **Manual Triggers**
