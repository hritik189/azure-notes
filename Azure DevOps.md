# DevOps & Azure DevOps

## What is DevOps?

>**DevOps** is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that combines **software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops)**. Its goal is to shorten the software development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

### DevOps Methodology Promotes:

- Collaboration between developers and operations teams
- Automation of the software delivery process
- Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)
- Monitoring and feedback loops for continuous improvement

### Key Principles of DevOps

1. **Collaboration:** Breaks down silos between development and operations
2. **Automation:** Automates repetitive tasks like testing, integration, and deployment
3. **Continuous Integration (CI):** Developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository
4. **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Code changes are automatically tested and prepared for release
5. **Monitoring and Feedback:** Real-time monitoring to detect issues early and improve performance

### Benefits of DevOps

- Faster time to market
- Improved deployment frequency
- More stable operating environments
- Better collaboration and communication
- Reduced failure rate of new releases
- Higher software quality
- Faster recovery from failures

## Cloud Computing Overview

>**Cloud computing** is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).

### Cloud Service Models

#### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet
- Examples: Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Storage
- Customer manages: OS, middleware, runtime, data, applications
- Provider manages: Virtualization, servers, storage, networking

#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications
- Examples: Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database
- Customer manages: Data, applications
- Provider manages: Runtime, middleware, OS, virtualization, servers, storage, networking

#### Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Delivers software applications over the internet
- Examples: Microsoft 365, Salesforce
- Customer manages: Data
- Provider manages: Everything else

### Cloud Deployment Models

- **Benefits**:
  - Avoid vendor lock-in
  - Optimize performance and cost
  - Improve resilience and redundancy
- **Use Cases**:
  - Hosting workloads in different regions/providers
  - Leveraging unique services from different clouds
  - Disaster recovery and backup across clouds

### Azure Arc
- **Definition**: `Azure Arc extends Azure management and services to **on-premises**, **multi-cloud**, and **edge** environments`
- **Capabilities**:
  - Manage **non-Azure resources** (e.g., AWS, GCP, on-prem servers) from the Azure portal
  - Apply **Azure Policies**, **RBAC**, and **Security Center** to hybrid resources
  - Run **Azure services** like Azure SQL and Kubernetes anywhere

## Shared Responsibility Model in Cloud Computing

>The **Shared Responsibility Model** defines how security and compliance responsibilities are divided between the **cloud provider** (e.g., Azure, AWS) and the **customer**.

### Core Principle

- **Cloud Provider**: Responsible for the **security *of* the cloud** (infrastructure, hardware, software)
- **Customer**: Responsible for the **security *in* the cloud** (data, access, configurations)

### Responsibility by Service Model

| Responsibility Area      | IaaS (Infrastructure) | PaaS (Platform) | SaaS (Software) |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Physical infrastructure  | Provider              | Provider        | Provider        |
| Network controls         | Shared                | Shared          | Provider        |
| Operating system         | Customer              | Provider        | Provider        |
| Applications             | Customer              | Shared          | Provider        |
| Data & access management | Customer              | Customer        | Customer        |
| Identity & directory     | Customer              | Customer        | Customer        |

### Examples

- **IaaS (e.g., Azure VMs)**:
  - You manage: OS, apps, data, network config
  - Azure manages: physical servers, storage, networking

- **PaaS (e.g., Azure App Services)**:
  - You manage: app code, data
  - Azure manages: OS, runtime, infrastructure

- **SaaS (e.g., Microsoft 365)**:
  - You manage: user access, data
  - Azure manages: everything else
