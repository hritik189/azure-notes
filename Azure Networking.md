## Networking Fundamentals

### IP Addressing

>IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are unique identifiers assigned to devices on a network, enabling communication between devices.

#### IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)
- **32-bit** address written in decimal notation
- Format: `192.168.1.1`
- Total addresses: ~4.3 billion
- Still widely used in most networks

##### IPv4 Address Classes:
| Class | Range | Default Subnet Mask | Usage | Hosts per Network |
|-------|-------|-------------------|-------|------------------|
| A | 1.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255 | 255.0.0.0 (/8) | Large networks | 16,777,214 |
| B | 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255 | 255.255.0.0 (/16) | Medium networks | 65,534 |
| C | 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255 | 255.255.255.0 (/24) | Small networks | 254 |
| D | 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255 | N/A | Multicast | N/A |
| E | 240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255 | N/A | Reserved | N/A |

##### Private IP Ranges (RFC 1918):
- **Class A**: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
- **Class B**: 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
- **Class C**: 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)

#### IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)
- **128-bit** address written in hexadecimal
- Format: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`
- Total addresses: ~340 undecillion
- Designed to replace IPv4 due to address exhaustion

##### IPv6 Features:
- No need for NAT (Network Address Translation)
- Built-in IPSec security
- Simplified header structure
- Auto-configuration capabilities
- Better multicast support

#### Real-World Example:
In a corporate environment, IPv4 private addresses are used internally (192.168.1.0/24), while IPv6 is increasingly used for internet-facing services and modern applications that require direct connectivity without NAT.

### Network Address Translation (NAT)

NAT translates private IP addresses to public IP addresses, allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP.

#### Types of NAT:
- **Static NAT**: One-to-one mapping between private and public IPs
- **Dynamic NAT**: Maps private IPs to a pool of public IPs
- **PAT (Port Address Translation)**: Many-to-one mapping using different ports

#### Real-World Use Case:
Home routers use PAT to allow multiple devices (phones, laptops, smart TVs) to share a single public IP address from the ISP.

### Domain Name System (DNS)

DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

#### DNS Resolution Process:
1. User enters URL in browser
2. Browser checks local cache
3. OS queries DNS resolver (ISP)
4. Resolver queries:
   - Root DNS server → TLD server
   - TLD server → Authoritative server
   - Authoritative server → Returns IP
5. IP address returned to browser
6. Browser connects to the IP address

#### DNS Record Types:
- **A Record**: Maps domain to IPv4 address
- **AAAA Record**: Maps domain to IPv6 address
- **CNAME**: Canonical name (alias)
- **MX**: Mail exchange server
- **TXT**: Text records for verification
- **NS**: Name server records

## Azure Virtual Network (VNet)

Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the fundamental building block for private networks in Azure. It provides:

### Key Features:
- **Isolation**: Logically isolated network environment
- **Segmentation**: Divide network into subnets
- **Connectivity**: Connect Azure resources securely
- **Hybrid Connectivity**: Extend on-premises networks
- **Traffic Control**: Manage traffic flow with routing and filtering

### VNet Components:

#### Address Space:
- Defined using CIDR notation (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
- Can have multiple address spaces
- Must not overlap with connected networks
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6

#### Subnets:
- Logical divisions within a VNet
- Each subnet has its own address range
- Resources are deployed into subnets
- Different subnets can have different security policies

#### Network Interfaces:
- Virtual network interfaces for VMs
- Can have multiple NICs per VM
- Support static and dynamic IP assignment

### VNet Planning Considerations:

#### Address Space Planning:
- Plan for future growth
- Consider integration with on-premises networks
- Avoid overlapping address spaces
- Use appropriate subnet sizes

#### Regional Considerations:
- VNets are regional resources
- Cannot span multiple regions
- Use VNet peering for cross-region connectivity

#### Real-World Example:
An enterprise creates a VNet with address space 10.0.0.0/16, dividing it into subnets for web servers (10.0.1.0/24), application servers (10.0.2.0/24), and database servers (10.0.3.0/24) to implement network segmentation and security policies.

---

## Subnets

Subnets are logical subdivisions of a VNet that provide network segmentation and traffic control.

### Subnet Design Principles:

#### Segmentation Benefits:
- **Security**: Isolate resources by function or security requirements
- **Traffic Control**: Manage traffic flow between segments
- **Performance**: Reduce broadcast traffic
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for data isolation

#### Subnet Types:

- **Database Tier**: Database servers
- **Management Tier**: Jump boxes and management tools

##### Service Subnets:
- **Gateway Subnet**: For VPN and ExpressRoute gateways
- **Azure Firewall Subnet**: For Azure Firewall deployment
- **Azure Bastion Subnet**: For Azure Bastion service

### Subnet Configuration:

#### Address Assignment:
- Must be within VNet address space
- Cannot overlap with other subnets
- First 3 and last IP addresses are reserved by Azure
- Minimum subnet size is /29 (8 IPs, 3 usable)

#### Service Endpoints:
- Extend VNet private address space to Azure services
- Traffic stays on Microsoft backbone network
- Supported services: Storage, SQL Database, Key Vault, etc.

#### Network Policies:
- Can be associated with NSGs

## Network Security Groups (NSG)

Network Security Groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet and network interface level.

### NSG Core Concepts:

#### Security Rules:
Each NSG contains multiple security rules that define:
- **Priority**: Lower numbers have higher priority (100-4096)
- **Direction**: Inbound or outbound
- **Action**: Allow or deny
- **Protocol**: TCP, UDP, or Any
- **Source/Destination**: IP addresses, CIDR blocks, or service tags
- **Ports**: Specific ports or port ranges

#### Default Rules:
NSGs include default rules that cannot be deleted:

##### Inbound Default Rules:
- **AllowVNetInBound**: Allow traffic within VNet
- **AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound**: Allow Azure Load Balancer traffic
- **DenyAllInBound**: Deny all other inbound traffic

##### Outbound Default Rules:
- **AllowVNetOutBound**: Allow traffic within VNet
- **AllowInternetOutBound**: Allow outbound internet traffic
- **DenyAllOutBound**: Deny all other outbound traffic

### NSG Association:

#### Subnet-Level Association:
- Applied to all resources in the subnet
- Provides broad security policies
- More efficient for large deployments

#### Network Interface-Level Association:
- Applied to specific VMs
- Provides granular control
- Useful for exceptions to subnet policies

### Service Tags:
Predefined groups of IP addresses for Azure services:
- **Internet**: All internet IP addresses
- **VirtualNetwork**: All VNet address spaces
- **Storage**: Azure Storage service IP addresses
- **Sql**: Azure SQL Database IP addresses
- **AzureKeyVault**: Azure Key Vault IP addresses

### NSG Flow Logs:
- Capture information about IP traffic
- Stored in Azure Storage accounts
- Used for security analysis and compliance
- Can be analyzed with Azure Network Watcher

### Real-World Example:
A web application NSG allows:
- **Inbound**: HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) from Internet
- **Inbound**: SSH (22) from management subnet only
- **Outbound**: HTTPS (443) to database subnet
- **Deny**: All other traffic

## Application Security Groups (ASG)

Application Security Groups provide a way to group virtual machines and define network security policies based on application workloads.

### ASG Benefits:

#### Simplified Security Management:
- Group VMs by application function
- Define security rules using application context
- Reduce complexity of IP-based rules
- Support dynamic membership

#### Scalability:
- Add/remove VMs from groups easily
- Rules automatically apply to new group members
- No need to update IP addresses in rules

### ASG Implementation:

#### Creating ASGs:
1. Define application groups (WebServers, AppServers, DBServers)
2. Associate VMs with appropriate ASGs
3. Create NSG rules using ASGs as source/destination
4. Apply NSGs to subnets or NICs

#### ASG Rules Example:
```
Rule: Allow HTTP traffic
- Source: Internet
- Destination: WebServers ASG
- Port: 80
- Protocol: TCP
- Action: Allow

Rule: Allow database access
- Source: AppServers ASG
- Destination: DBServers ASG
- Port: 1433
- Protocol: TCP
- Action: Allow
```

### NSG vs ASG Comparison:

| Feature | NSG | ASG |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **Purpose** | Traffic filtering | VM grouping |
| **Scope** | Subnet/NIC level | VM-level grouping |
| **Rules** | IP-based | Group-based |
| **Management** | Manual IP updates | Dynamic membership |
| **Complexity** | Higher for large deployments | Lower complexity |

### Real-World Example:
An e-commerce application uses ASGs to organize:
- **WebTier-ASG**: Web servers handling HTTP requests
- **AppTier-ASG**: Application servers processing business logic
- **DBTier-ASG**: Database servers storing application data
- **Mgmt-ASG**: Management and monitoring servers

## CIDR Notation

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing IP packets.

### CIDR Basics:

#### Format:
- IP address followed by slash and prefix length
- Example: 192.168.1.0/24
- Prefix length indicates network portion bits

#### Subnet Mask Conversion:
- /24 = 255.255.255.0
- /16 = 255.255.0.0
- /8 = 255.0.0.0

### Common CIDR Blocks:

| CIDR | Subnet Mask | Hosts | Use Case |
|------|-------------|-------|----------|
| /30 | 255.255.255.252 | 2 | Point-to-point links |
| /29 | 255.255.255.248 | 6 | Small subnets |
| /28 | 255.255.255.240 | 14 | Small office networks |
| /27 | 255.255.255.224 | 30 | Department networks |
| /26 | 255.255.255.192 | 62 | Medium subnets |
| /24 | 255.255.255.0 | 254 | Standard subnet |
| /23 | 255.255.254.0 | 510 | Large subnets |
| /22 | 255.255.252.0 | 1022 | Very large subnets |
| /16 | 255.255.0.0 | 65534 | Large networks |

### CIDR Calculations:

#### Available Hosts:
- Formula: 2^(32-prefix) - 2
- Subtract 2 for network and broadcast addresses
- Example: /24 = 2^8 - 2 = 254 hosts

#### Subnetting:
- Divide larger networks into smaller subnets
- Increase prefix length to create subnets
- Example: 10.0.0.0/16 → 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24, etc.

### Azure CIDR Considerations:

#### VNet Address Space:
- Plan for future growth
- Consider integration needs
- Avoid overlapping with on-premises networks

#### Subnet Planning:
- Reserve address space for future subnets
- Consider service requirements (Gateway subnet needs /27 minimum)
- Plan for different tiers and functions

### Real-World Example:
A company plans their Azure network:
- **VNet**: 10.0.0.0/16 (65,534 addresses)
- **Web Subnet**: 10.0.1.0/24 (254 addresses)
- **App Subnet**: 10.0.2.0/24 (254 addresses)
- **DB Subnet**: 10.0.3.0/24 (254 addresses)
- **Gateway Subnet**: 10.0.255.0/27 (30 addresses)
